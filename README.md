## Hello, I'm CJ!
I'm an aspiring graphics programmer with various interests such as: 
- :movie_camera: Animation (*Blender*)
- :video_game: Game Development (*Unity*)
- :paintbrush: Generative Art (*Processing*)
- :triangular_ruler: Mathematics
- :books: Linguistics, History, Philosophy, Literature

I can programme in *Java*, *C/C++*, and *Python*. I plan on digging into *OpenGL* and the *Godot Game Engine* soon.

Eventually I'll make a portfolio website to showcase my projects. Feel free to contact me on Instagram (linked on profile) or email me at `satnarinecj101@gmail.com`.
