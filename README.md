## Hello, I'm CJ!
I'm an aspiring graphics programmer/technical artist with various interests in: 
- :movie_camera: Animation (*Blender*)
- :video_game: Game Development (*Unity*, *focussing more on Godot now*)
- :paintbrush: Generative Art (*Processing*)
- :triangular_ruler: Mathematics
- :books: Linguistics, History, Philosophy, Literature

I am trying to learn a lot of things that relate to the above interests. I am also trying to relearn a lot of things I'm rusty with. 
Currently, I am focussing on learning **OpenGL** and shader programming, as well as relearning **Blender**. My [portfolio website](https://cjsatnarine.github.io/) is slowly being updated so check that out if you're interested!

Feel free to contact me on:
- Discord: `.just_cj`
- E-mail: `satnarinecj101@gmail.com`.
