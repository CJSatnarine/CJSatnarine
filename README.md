## Hello, I'm CJ!
I'm an aspiring graphics programmer with various interests such as: 
- :movie_camera: Animation (*Blender*)
- :video_game: Game Development (*Unity*, *focussing more on Godot now*)
- :paintbrush: Generative Art (*Processing*)
- :triangular_ruler: Mathematics
- :books: Linguistics, History, Philosophy, Literature

I can programme in *Java*, *C/C++*, and *Python*. 

Currently learning **OpenGL** and relearning a lot of stuff.

Eventually I'll make a portfolio website to showcase my projects. Feel free to contact me on Instagram (`cjsatnarine`), message me on Discord (`.just_cj`), or e-mail me at `satnarinecj101@gmail.com`.
